# KeyLogger
This Python script, using `pynput`, acts as a basic keylogger, capturing keyboard events and distinguishing between alphanumeric and special keys. It logs the pressed keys to a "log.txt" file for educational or ethical purposes. Always ensure ethical use and comply with legal regulations, obtaining explicit permission when monitoring individuals.
